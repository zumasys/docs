Roles are used to partition users into related groups. Every user must be assigned one or more roles. Examples of roles are administrator, user, warehouse, customer service, developer, etc. As noted below, each user has a role, and each profile is assigned to specific roles. It is the intersection of user roles and profile roles that determines which profile(s) a user is able to open.



### Info

Prior to creating a user, you will need to have already created your [Customer Portal User](/customerportal/quick-start) and be assigned as an Administrator to your company's account.



1. Expand the AccuTerm module from the main navigation page in the Customer Portal and select Users & Licenses.
