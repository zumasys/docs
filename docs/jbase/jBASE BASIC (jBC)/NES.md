# Description

The function is used to determine whether elements of one dynamic array are equal to the elements of another dynamic array.

```
NES(array1, array2)
```

Each element of **array1** is compared with the corresponding element of **array2**. If the two elements are equal, a 0 is returned in the corresponding element of a new dynamic array. If the two elements are not equal, a 1 is returned. If an element of one dynamic array has no corresponding element in the other dynamic array, a 1 is returned. If either of a corresponding pair of elements is null, null is returned for that element.
