# Register Reconciliation

<PageHeader />

- **Register Reconciliation**
    1. After you have **CLOSE**d the register(s) (ran the **Z** tape) and have brought the drawer with all the Cash, Checks, Credit Card Charges, AR Charges, Gift Certificates, Return Receipts and whatever other items back to the office, print the _Tender/Register Summary_
    2. Count your drawer down to your pre-determined drawer amount.
    3. Count all your **cash** and compare to the Tender/Register Summary report.
    4. Count and run a tape on all your **checks** and compare against the Tender/Register Summary report.
        1. Include _Travelers Checks_ as checks.
    5. Count and run a tape on all your **credit card charges** and compare against the Tender/Register Summary report.
        1. You will need to add the various credit cards (Mastercard, Visa, Discover…) together from the Tender/Register Summary report to get the total of all credit card charges
    6. Count and run a tape on all your **AR charges** and compare against the Tender/Register Summary report.
    7. Count any other items (if any – Gift Certificates, CPN…) and compare against the Tender/Register Summary report.
    8. Add all your counts to determine if you are long or short for that drawer.
- **Reconcile against Spreadsheet**
    1. From the _Tender/Register Summary_ report, use the **TOTAL** column when getting numbers for the _Departments_.
        1. Remember to add together for the **TEXT** category:
            - _NEW TEXTBOOKS_
            - _USED TEXTBOOKS_
            - _TRADEBOOKS_
            - _OPTIONAL TEXTBOOKS_
        2. If there are any _FIX_ or _ERROR_ lines, decide what departments they belong to
            - Once you assign these items a _class_, they will be grouped into the correct departments.
        3. From the spreadsheet:
            1. CHGS = ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
            2. DISC = TRANS DISCS/MKDNS

- REF = RETURNS
    - Remember to include tax

1. TAX = SALES TAX
2. DEPARTMENTS = DEPARTMENTS
    - Remember to add together the departments that you need to on the _Tender/Register Summary_
3. CASH ON HAND = TOTAL (of Tenders) less ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

- SHORT = cash short, LONG = cash long

1. The TTL line on the spreadsheet should match the amount of the REF line.
