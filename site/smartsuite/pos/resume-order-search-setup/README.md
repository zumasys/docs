# Resume Order Search Setup

<PageHeader />

## Searching Suspended Orders

Purpose of this document is to setup a search box prompt when you are resuming a transaction, for the purpose of eCommerce or Mail Order transaction resuming. The search will allow you to lookup orders without browsing through all of you open orders. _\*if you wish to bypass this step you can press enter for the default option to scroll through all of you open or suspended orders._

This setup can replace scrolling through a long list of customer orders to find the desired order.

The search can be performed on suspended transactions on any one of the following items. Phone Number _format xxx-xxx-xxxx_ First or Last name Order confirmation number Email address

**prerequisite:** Mail Order Registers or Online Order Registers must be setup on the system you are resuming transactions on. Applies only to host based registers or back-office connections.
