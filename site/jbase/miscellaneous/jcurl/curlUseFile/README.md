# curlUseFile

Tells the curl operation to read or write (depending on the command/direction) directly to the given file name.

## Synax:

***result_code*** = **curlUseFile**(***curlHandle***, ***fileName***, ***mode***)

where:

| Variable | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
***result_code*** | integer | result code
***curlHandle*** | var | a [jCURL](../../jcurl) handle generated by [curlInit](../curlinit)

## Example

```
INCLUDE JBCCURL.h
rc = curlInit(curlHandle)
... perform curl operations with curlHandle
rc = curlUseFile(curlHandle, '/tmp/curl_results', 'w+')
rc = curlExec(curlHandle, result, headers)
...
```
