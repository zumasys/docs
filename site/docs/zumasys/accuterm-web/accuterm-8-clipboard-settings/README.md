| Paste end-of-line: | When the clipboard is "pasted" to an AccuTerm session, AccuTerm transmits the clipboard text to the host computer. The end of line options determine what AccuTerm does at the end of each line: send CR (default), send LF, send CF+ LF, send TAB, do nothing, or send a user-defined character. To specify a user-defined character, select the user-defined option and enter the ASCII code of the character to be sent at the end of each line. If you do not want the end-of-line character to be sent after the last (or only) line pasted, check the Do not send line-end after last (or only) line pasted option.<br> |

| Paste end-of-text: | After pasting the clipboard to an AccuTerm session, AccuTerm can send an optional end of text character. Normally, AccuTerm does not transmit any character at this time, but you can select EOF (which is the SUB or CTRL+Z control code), or send a user-defined character. To specify a user-defined character, select the user-defined option and enter the ASCII code of the character to be sent at the end of a paste operation.<br> |
