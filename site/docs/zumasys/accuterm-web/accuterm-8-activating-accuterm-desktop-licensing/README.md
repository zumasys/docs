One of the changes in AccuTerm 8 is how it is now licensed, by the user. In order to activate AccuTerm 8 Desktop, a user first needs to be provisioned in the [Customer Portal](accuterm-8-adding-users). Upon being provisioned, the user will receive the license key by email and the administrator can view it in the Customer Portal by selecting the user.



### Warning

If you have an AccuTerm 8 Desktop device license, please do not enter an email address when activating the license key.

After installing Accuterm 8 Desktop, the License Activation prompt will display and you will enter the user's email and license key that is associated with the user's email address and select the Activate AccuTerm button.

### Note

You can download the latest version of AccuTerm by visiting [https://www.zumasys.com/downloads/](https://www.zumasys.com/downloads/)  and selecting the AccuTerm section.

The Internet is required for activation and if the install is not activated, AccuTerm will enter evaluation mode until the license can be activated.
