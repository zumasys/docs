**Send Email to Rep** This controls whether the rep is emailed the sales order
changes. The email address on the REP file is used.  
  
**Email Address** Enter the email addresses that will be sent a change notice.
The email addresses will appear in a list when the price record is saved. They
can optionally be selected or not at that time. The default selection is
controlled with the next field.  
  
**Default Email** When a sales order is filed and a change notice is
triggered, then the email addresses will appear in a list to optionally be
sent the notice. This field controls whether this email address is always
defaulted to send a notice.  
  
**So Field Number** This is the field number in the SO file. Use the help
option to load in selected fields that when changed will cause a change notice
to be sent and/or will appear on the change notice itself. The fields that
trigger a change notice will also be maintained in a SO change history log.  
  
**So Field Name** This is the field name corresponding with the field number
entered/selected.  
  
**Trigger Change Notice?** If checked, then a change to this field on a SO
record will cause a change notice to be sent and SO history data to be stored
indicating what changed.  
  
**Include in Change Notice?** If checked, then this data will be included in
the change notice. By default, any data field that triggers a change
notice/change history will be included in any email sent.
