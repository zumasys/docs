**Purpose**  
The VENDOR.E procedure provides for the entry and maintenance of the Vendor
Master file (VENDOR). The ID to each vendor record may be assigned by the user
or automatically by the system. Each record contains descriptive information
about the vendor such as their name, address, telephone and fax numbers,
Contact, buyer, and default terms code. Many of these data elements are used
as defaults in the purchase order entry and accounts payable procedures.

**Frequency of Use**  
Vendors are usually loaded initially when the system is first installed, with
additions being made in the future as required.

**Prerequisites**  
Entry of terms records if they are to be referenced in the vendor records ( [ TERMS.E ](../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/TERMS-E/README.md) ).
