**Purpose**  
The AR.CONTROL procedure is used to define default information which will be
used by the Accounts Receivable procedures.

The entries in this procedure must be loaded prior to using any of the other
procedures in the Accounts Receivable Module. This is usually done as part of
setting up the system. The entries may be changed after that time as required.

**Prerequisites**  
The General Ledger account number must have been previously defined in the chart of accounts ( [ GLCHART.E ](../../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/AP-E/CHECKS-E/AP-CONTROL/GLCHART-E) ).
