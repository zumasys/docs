**Process** Select the method to be used for processing the report. Foreground

available in the list that allow you to submit the job for processing in the
background or at a predefined time such as overnight. A system printer must be
specified when using these queues.

depends on what is allowed by each procedure. Possible formats include Text,
Excel, Word, PDF, HTML, Comma delimited and Tab delimited.

appropriate setting in this field. Set the value to Portrait if the page is to
be oriented with the shorter dimension (usually 8.5 inches) at the top or

Portrait will always be available but Landscape is dependent on the output
destination and may not be available in all cases.

imposed.

up to 100% are included.
