##  A/P Items Awaiting Invoicing (AP.R1)

<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](AP-R1-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The AP.R1 procedure is used to create a listing of all A/P items which are in
the AP file, but which have not yet been invoiced. The report will select all
A/P items which do not have an invoice number present. The records which will
normally qualify for this report have been created through the receiving
process.  
  
A cutoff date is prompted when running this report. All items received through
the Receiving process through the date entered will be selected for this
report. Leaving the cutoff date null assumes you wish to print all accrual
items.  
  
This is not a balancing report to be used in reconciling the General Ledger. It looks only at the current state of the accounts payable file. For balancing the accrual account, use the [ AP.R9 ](../AP-R9/README.md) report. 

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
None.
