**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](APREG-P1-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The [ APREG.R1 ](../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-REPORT/APREG-R1/README.md) procedure is used to purge APREG records from the data base. The criteria used to deterime which records are purged is based on a user defined cut-off date. All APREG records which have a posted date that is less than or equal to the cut-off date will be deleted. The post date indicates that the record was posted to general ledger. 

**Frequency of Use**  
The frequency with which a purge is performed will vary depending on such
factors as available disk space and the amount of on-line history desired. At
a minimum purges should be performed on a yearly basis. Purging on a quarterly
or even a monthly basis may be desirable if the volume of transactions is
fairly high.

**Prerequisites**  
It is strongly recommended that a full account backup be performed prior to
executing any purge process. It is also recommended that this be a permanent
backup so that any records which were purged can be restored at a later date
if required.
