[ Form Details ](CHECKS-P4-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
Checks.p4 is used to reassign the check numbers in the ap, apreg and checks
files for posted checks. This procedure is used to correct the check numbers
when a error occurred during the printing process and was not detected until
after the check run was posted.  
  
This procedure should be used with caution. When a check is deleted/voided via [ checks.e ](../../AP-ENTRY/CHECKS-E/README.md) or [ checks.e2 ](../../AP-ENTRY/CHECKS-E2/README.md) , reversing entries are made in the apreg, ap and/or check files to reflect this transaction. Checks.p4, however, does not create these reversing transactions. Instead it changes the check numbers posted to the ap, apreg and checks files. A date stamp is posted to the new check number in the checks file to indicate that the check was created/updated via this procedure.   

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.
