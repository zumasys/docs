##  Master Schedule Purge Process (MS.P1)

<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](MS-P1-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The MS.P1 procedure is used to remove past due dates and quantities from the
master schedule records.

**Frequency of Use**  
If you are using the [ PLAN.E ](../../MFG-ENTRY/PLAN-E/README.md) procedure to release work orders from master, schedule items, then you probably do not need to run this process until the next time you are ready to lay out the production schedule. If you release work order manually and do not manually remove the dates and quantities associated with the release from the master schedule, then you will need to run this procedure on a regular basis to remove the dates and quantities consumed so that demand is not inflated. 

**Prerequisites**  
None.
