**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](PLAN-CONTROL-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
PLAN.CONTROL is used to specify which planning groups are available to the
system. Planning groups allow you to process MRP, MPS, CRP and other inventory
and production functions independently from one another. You also define the
size and number of periods to be used when generating the MRP and MPS
horizontal reports. You specify the number of periods by entering the number
of days for each period. You can also limit the types of sales orders to be
included in processing, and indicate if status "N" (new) work order's schedule
dates are firm or variable.

**Frequency of Use**  
Typically when first seeting up the system, or when changes or additions are
required.

**Prerequisites**  
None.
