##  CRP Processing Controls (CRP.CONTROL)

<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](CRP-CONTROL-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The CRP.CONTROL procedure is used to define the parameters to be used in processing the Capacity Requirements Planning (CRP) system. These parameters include the planning horizon, work centers to be analyzed and if capacity is to be updated on-line. Default settings to be used for the Capacity Requirements Planning Inquiry ( [ CRP.Q ](../../MFG-REPORT/CRP-Q/README.md) ) are also defined. 

**Frequency of Use**  
The entries in this procedure must be loaded prior to using the Capacity Requirements Planning processes. This is usually done as part of setting up the system. The entries may be changed after that time as required, but the [ CRP.P1 ](../../MFG-PROCESS/CRP-P1/README.md) procedure must be run to make the changes effective. 

**Prerequisites**  
None.
