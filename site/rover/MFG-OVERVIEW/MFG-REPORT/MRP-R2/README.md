will also show each next higher level assembly until it reaches the highest
level in the product structure generating demand.

As required.

Building of the MRP files ( [ MRP.P1 ](../../MFG-PROCESS/MRP-P1/README.md) ).

for the prior and base part numbers.  
**Assembly Description** The first line of the description for each of the
assemblies listed.
