**Purpose**  
The WO.P4 procedure is used to calculate and post the accumulated variances
for standard cost work orders. This allows you to post each variance amount
accumulated within the period it was accrued rather than waiting until the
work order is completed and finalized.  
  
The variances calculated are material, labor, outside processing, fixed
overhead, variable overhead and material overhead.

**Frequency of Use**  
Usually run as part of the month end closing process.

**Prerequisites**  
None.
