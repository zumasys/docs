<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](EMPTIME-P2-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
This procedure is used for logging all employees out of the jobs they are currently logged into. This would replace the use of [ EMPTIME.E4 ](../../PRO-ENTRY/EMPTIME-E4/README.md) and could be used in situations such as fire-drills, a power outage that suspends all work, or sudden plant closure. It produces a report of all employees and jobs that were logged out. 

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
Employee information must be entered using the [ EMP.E ](../../PRO-ENTRY/EMP-E/README.md) procedure and control parameters must be defined in the [ LABOR.CONTROL ](../../PRO-ENTRY/LABOR-CONTROL/README.md) procedure.
