##  Work Order Cross-Reference Rebuild Process (WO.P1)

<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](WO-P1-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The WO.P1 procedure rebuilds the work order to part number cross-reference
file (WOPART).

**Frequency of Use**  
The cross-reference is maintained automatically as work orders are entered.
Therefore, the only time you really need to run this procedure is when the
file has been corrupted or records have been purged from the work order file.

**Prerequisites**  
Entry of work order records ( [ WO.E ](../../PRO-ENTRY/WO-E/README.md) ).
