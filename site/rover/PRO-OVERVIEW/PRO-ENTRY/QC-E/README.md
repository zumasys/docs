**Purpose**  
The QC.E procedure is used to enter test results and ultimately disposition parts after inspection. The QC may reference a PO receipt, a work order, or be processed directly to a part number. The test steps and instructions may be predefined in [ PARTS.E ](../../../ENG-OVERVIEW/ENG-ENTRY/PARTS-E/README.md) . They will be auto-loaded when the part number is entered.   
  
Once the test is complete, the user has the option of accepting or rejecting
all or part of the quantity. Additionally, they can invoke screens to issue
inspected parts to inventory, make shop movements, perform work order
completions, scrap material, create an NCMR, etc.

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
None. Test steps and instructions may be predefined in [ PARTS.E ](../../../ENG-OVERVIEW/ENG-ENTRY/PARTS-E/README.md) to make the data entry easier.
