##  Work Order Dekit Process (WO.E3)

<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](WO-E3-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The WO.E3 procedure is used to de-kit work orders which have already been pulled. This process effectively reverses the picking procedure ( [ PICKER.E2 ](../PICKER-E2/README.md) ) by returning all previously pulled material to the original stocking location from which it came. Both quantity and cost are re- moved from the work order. 

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
Work orders must have a status of "P" (pulled) or "S" (started).
