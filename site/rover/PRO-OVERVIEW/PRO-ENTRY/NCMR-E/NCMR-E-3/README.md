This is only stored if one of two conditions are met: 1) The parameters are set in [ CHANGE.CONTROL ](../../../../ACE-OVERVIEW/ACE-ENTRY/CHANGE-CONTROL/README.md) and a change was made that met the criteria for storing change history or 2) Change notes were entered by the user. This field is system controlled.   
  
**Change Time** The time the cost record was changed. This is system
controlled.  
  
**Change By** The User ID of the person who changed the cost record. This is
system controlled.  
  
**Change App By** Enter the name or initials of the person who approved the
cost record change.  
  
**Change Text** This is change text that is generated by the system based on the settings in [ CHANGE.CONTROL ](../../../../ACE-OVERVIEW/ACE-ENTRY/CHANGE-CONTROL/README.md) defining which fields trigger a change. Changes to those fields will be noted here. This text will also be included in cost record change notices sent by email.

time. These notes will also be included in cost record change notices sent by
