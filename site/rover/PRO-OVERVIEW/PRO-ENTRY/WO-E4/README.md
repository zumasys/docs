##  Work Order Release (WO.E4)

<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](WO-E4-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The WO.E4 procedure is used to enter release work orders. The screen allows
the user to select unreleased work orders (those with a status of "N" or "O"),
and/or released work orders (status of "R"). Released orders that are loaded
onto the screen cannot be re-processed, but the user can reprint the work
order documents on demand.  
  
The work orders can be sorted by work order date, release date, required date,
part number or customer name.

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
The work orders must already exist in the system. Also, [ FORM.CONTROL ](../../../ACE-OVERVIEW/ACE-ENTRY/FORM-CONTROL/README.md) must be set up to determine what documents to print during a reprint selection.
