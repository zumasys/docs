This is only stored if one of two conditions are met: 1) The parameters are set in [ CHANGE.CONTROL ](../../../../../../../../../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/VENDOR-E/VENDOR-E-5/CHANGE-CONTROL) and a change was made that met the criteria for storing change history or 2) Change notes were entered by the user. This field is system controlled.   
  
**Change Time** The time the price record was changed. This is system
controlled.  
  
**Changed By** The User ID of the person who changed the picker record. This
is system controlled.  
  
**Approved By** The name or initials of the person who approved the picker
record change.  
  
**Change Text** This is change text that is generated by the system based on the settings in [ CHANGE.CONTROL ](../../../../../../../../../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/VENDOR-E/VENDOR-E-5/CHANGE-CONTROL) defining which fields trigger a change. Changes to those fields will be noted here. This text will also be included in picker record change notices sent by email.
