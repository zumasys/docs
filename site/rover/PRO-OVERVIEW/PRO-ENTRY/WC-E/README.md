convention defined in advance.  
  
The information contained in each record consists of a description, crew size,
the standard hours for the work center including pre-operation, post
operation, setup and run hours, and percentages for fixed and variable
overhead calculations and rate. Capacity for the work center is also defined
in this procedure.  
  
A work center cannot be deleted if it is referenced on a routing or open work
order record.
