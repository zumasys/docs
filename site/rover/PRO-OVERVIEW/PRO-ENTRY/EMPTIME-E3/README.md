The employee must log out of one job before starting another unless they have setup with multi-job capability through a setting in the [ EMP.E ](../EMP-E/README.md) procedure.

As required.

Employee information must be entered using the [ EMP.E ](../EMP-E/README.md) procedure and control parameters must be defined in the [ LABOR.CONTROL ](../LABOR-CONTROL/README.md) and [ BAR.CONTROL ](../BAR-CONTROL/README.md) procedures.
