##  Work Order Inventory Availability Listing (PICKER.R2)

<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](PICKER-R2-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The PICKER.R2 procedure provides the ability to perform a "What if" check
against an existing work order to determine the availability of the component
parts. The user specifies the work orders to be checked and the the method to
be used for performing the check. He also specifies if he wants to see the
status of all components, or only those which show a potential shortage.  
  
There are two methods which may be used to check the available inventory. One
method checks the current inventory balance without regard to any other
demands on the components. The other method utilizes the projected balances as
calculated by MRP thus taking into account any other demands on the required
parts. The second method gives you a worst case scenerio since it assumes the
work order you are checking would be the last in line for the parts.

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.
