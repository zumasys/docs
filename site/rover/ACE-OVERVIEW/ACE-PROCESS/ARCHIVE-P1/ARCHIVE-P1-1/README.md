**Job ID** Enter a unique ID if you wish to enter and save the parameters to this procedure for future use. If you only need to run the procedure and do not want to save your entry then you may leave this field empty.

**Destination** Select the destination for the output from this procedure.

**Process** Select the method to be used for processing the report. Foreground is always available and must be used when output is directed to anything other than a system printer (i.e. printers spooled through the database on the host computer.) Depending on your setup there may be various batch process queues available in the list that allow you to submit the job for processing in the background or at a predefined time such as overnight. A system printer must be specified when using these queues.

**Format** Select the format for the output. The availability of other formats depends on what is allowed by each procedure. Possible formats include Text, Excel, Word, PDF, HTML, Comma delimited and Tab delimited.

**Layout** You may indicate the layout of the printed page by specifying the appropriate setting in this field. Set the value to Portrait if the page is to be oriented with the shorter dimension (usually 8.5 inches) at the top or Landscape if the longer dimension (usually 11 inches) is to be at the top. Portrait will always be available but Landscape is dependent on the output destination and may not be available in all cases.

**Copies** Enter the number of copies to be printed.

**Run Process** Click on the button to run the process. This performs the save function which may also be activated by clicking the save button in the tool bar or pressing the F9 key or Ctrl+S.

**Plan Group** Enter the plan group for which the archival and purge process should be executed. This field is required. If your system utilizes multiple plan groups, you will need to run a separate process for each plan group.

**Disable Indexes** Check this box to temporarily disable indexing during the archival and purge process. Disabling indexes drastically improves performance, but this option should only be used during off-hours or low-activity periods, as it affects system indexing while the process is running. Indexes are automatically re-enabled when the process completes.

**Last Status Message** Contains the last status message generated by the program.

**Last Status Date** The date on which the last status message was generated.

**Last Status Time** The time at which the last status message was generated.
