**Email Address** Enter the email addresses that will be sent a change notice.
The email addresses will appear in a list when the routing record is saved.
They can optionally be selected or not at that time. The default selection is
controlled with the next field.  
  
**Default Email** When a ROUTING record is filed and a change notice is
triggered, then the email addresses will appear in a list to optionally be
sent the notice. This field controls whether this email address is always
defaulted to send a notice.  
  
**Routing Field Number** This is the field number in the ROUTING file. Use the
help option to load in selected fields that when changed will cause a change
notice to be sent and/or will appear on the change notice itself. The fields
that trigger a change notice will also be maintained in a ROUTING change
history log.  
  
**Routing Field Name** This is the field name corresponding with the field
number entered/selected.  
  
**Trigger Change Notice?** If checked, then a change to this field on a
ROUTING record will cause a change notice to be sent and shipment history data
to be stored indicating what changed.  
  
**Include in Change Notice?** If checked, then this data will be included in
the change notice. By default, any data field that triggers a change
notice/change history will be included in any email sent.
