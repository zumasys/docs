**Email Address** Enter the email addresses that will be sent a change notice.
The email addresses will appear in a list when the BOM record is saved. They
can optionally be selected or not at that time. The default selection is
controlled with the next field.  
  
**Default Email** When a BOM record is filed and a change notice is triggered,
then the email addresses will appear in a list to optionally be sent the
notice. This field controls whether this email address is always defaulted to
send a notice.  
  
**Bom Data Field** This is the field number in the BOM file. Use the help
option to load in selected fields that when changed will cause a change notice
to be sent and/or will appear on the change notice itself. The fields that
trigger a change notice will also be maintained in a bill of material change
history log.  
  
**Bom Field Name** This is the field name corresponding with the field number
entered/selected.  
  
**Trigger Change Notice?** If checked, then a change to this field on a BOM
record will cause a change notice to be sent and bill of material history data
to be stored indicating what changed.  
  
**Include in Change Notice?** If checked, then this data will be included in
the change notice. By default, any data field that triggers a change
notice/change history will be included in any email sent.
