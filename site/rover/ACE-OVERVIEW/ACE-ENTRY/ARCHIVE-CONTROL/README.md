**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](ARCHIVE-CONTROL-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The ARCHIVE.CONTROL procedure is used to define archival and purge settings for the data account and correlated history account. For each file in the system, you can specify how long records should be retained before they are archived to the history account or deleted from the history account. This procedure controls the behavior of the archival process (ARCHIVE.P1) by setting the retention periods in months for both archiving and purging operations.

**Frequency of Use**  
The entries in this procedure are typically defined during initial system setup. Once configured, the settings rarely need to be changed unless business requirements for data retention are modified.

**Prerequisites**  
None.
