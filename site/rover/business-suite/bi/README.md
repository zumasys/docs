Rover BI is the dynamic and powerful web-based dashboarding and reporting platform available to users of many different ERPs, including but not limited to Rover, Smart Suite, Foresite, Crescendo, IMACS, Proman, SHIMS, AutoSHIMS, MIS, CUBS and more.

## Key Features

- **Multi‑Dashboard Homepages** – create several personal dashboards and switch between them from the home screen. Administrators can publish shared dashboards by role so each department sees the metrics that matter most.
- **Shared & Role-Based Dashboards** – design a dashboard once and share it with an entire team. Security settings control who can view or edit each dashboard or widget.
- **Interactive Data Visualizations** – filter, drill and refresh charts and tables in real time. The responsive layout works equally well on desktop or mobile devices.

## Using Rover BI

1. Open **Rover BI** from the Rover Hub menu.
2. Select **Add Dashboard** to create your own dashboard and add widgets for charts, tables or KPIs.
3. Switch between dashboards using the drop‑down on your BI homepage. Administrators manage global dashboards in **Web Control → Dashboards**.
4. Dashboards and widgets respect security permissions—items you do not have access to simply will not appear.
