**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](BARCODE-L1-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The BARCODE.L1 procedure is used to print bar codes for any set of char-
acters, description or procedure desired. This process allows the user to
enter specifically the information to be printed in bar code format and the
title or description which is to be printed underneath the bar code itself.  
  
This procedure is most commonly used to print control sheets of commands which will be posted next to bar code wanding stations. An example of this would be found next to a station where the [ ST.E ](../../../duplicates/ST-E/README.md) procedure is executed via a bar code device. The command " [ ST.E ](../../../duplicates/ST-E/README.md) ", the "File" option and any other pertinent data could be printed on a control sheet and posted next to the device. 

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
A printer which is capable of printing bar coding is required.
