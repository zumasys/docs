##  Transactions

![](./INV-Q-8.jpg)

**Trans Date** This field contains the transaction date. This is usually the same as the date that the transaction was processed on. However, in certain procedures ( [ SHIP.E2 ](../../../../MRK-OVERVIEW/MRK-ENTRY/SHIP-E2/README.md) , [ RECEIPTS.E ](../../../../PUR-OVERVIEW/PUR-ENTRY/RECEIPTS-E/README.md) ), the transaction date can be changed to a date other than the current date. Therefore, it is possible to process a transaction on 9/16/09 but date it 9/1/09. The date that appears in this field would be 9/1/09. The transaction detail lookup will display the date and time the transaction was processed on.
