<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](INV-R3-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The INV.R3 procedure is used to produce a report which displays the number of parts to be counted by date, as assigned by the cycle date assignment procedure ( [ INV.P1 ](../../INV-PROCESS/INV-P1/README.md) ). The report is run for a specific inventory location. This report is intended to be used to audit the effects of the [ INV.P1 ](../../INV-PROCESS/INV-P1/README.md) procedure and verify the number of parts to be counted by ABC code is correct. 

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
The [ INV.P1 ](../../INV-PROCESS/INV-P1/README.md) procedure should have been run to assign the cycle dates. 

**Data Fields**

**Date** The date on which the parts are to be counted. An entry of "No Date"
indicates there are stratified parts with no cycle dates assigned.  
**A.Parts** The number of A parts to be counted.  
**B.Parts** The number of B parts to be counted.  
**C.Parts** The number of C parts to be counted.  
**Other** The number of parts with no ABC code which have an assigned cycle
date.
