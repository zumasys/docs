[ Form Details ](GLRECUR-E-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
This procedure provides a means for automatically generating journal entries that must be entered every period. Its layout is similar to the standard journal entry procedure [ GLTRANS.E ](../GLTRANS-E/README.md) except for the addition of prompts that identify the time period for which the journals are to be created and on what day of the period. Entries are created in the GLTRANS file by running the procedure [ GLRECUR.P1 ](../../GL-PROCESS/GLRECUR-P1/README.md) , typically at the end of each period. 

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
Entry of general ledger account numbers through [ GLCHART.E ](../GLCHART-E/README.md) .
