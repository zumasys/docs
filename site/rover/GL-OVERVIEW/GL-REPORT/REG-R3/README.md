##  Unposted Register Listing for All Register Files (REG.R3)

<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](REG-R3-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The purpose of REG.R3 is to obtain a listing of the register records that have not yet been interfaced to the general ledger via [ GLINT.P1 ](../../GL-PROCESS/GLINT-P1/README.md) . A separate report will print for each register file that has unposted entries. There are four register files - APREG, ARREG, INVREG and WOREG - used by the system.   
  
The report can be run for a specific date range, account number or
module/register file. One of the primary reasons reports like the accounts
payable and receivable aging reports will not reconcile to the financial
reports is because not all register records have been interfaced to the
general ledger. Therefore, it is recommded, that this report be run monthly
for all accounts and modules with no starting date and an ending date equal to
the last day of the month being closed.

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
Register transactions must exist.

**Data Fields**

**Reg.Id** The register record number.  
**Reg.Date**
