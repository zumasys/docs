number, date and quantity due, and unit price. The system allows you to enter
multiple sets of the data (line items) one the second screen. You may also
enter multiple delivery dates and quantities for each line item.  
  
Requisitions may be deleted provided that no purchase orders have been placed
against them.

As required.

**Prerequisites**  
Initialization of the purchase order control record ( [ PO.CONTROL ](../PO-CONTROL/README.md) ), and entry of the vendors to be referenced.
