**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](PTAX-E-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The PTAX.E procedure is used to define the various purchase tax codes which will be used in processing Purchase Orders and Accounts Payable transactions. Each record specifies a description of the code and a purchase tax percent. The accrual account associated with purchase sales tax is defined in [ AP.CONTROL ](../../../AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/AP-CONTROL/README.md) , as well as a default tax code. 

**Frequency of Use**  
Purchase Tax codes are usually defined when the system is being setup prior to
any transaction processing. New codes may be added at any time, but care must
be taken when existing codes are changed which are referenced by other records
in the system.
