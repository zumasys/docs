<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](PO-F1-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The PO.F1 procedure is used to print purchase orders on pre-printed forms. One
of these forms is usually sent to the vendor, while others may be maintained
on file as a legal copy of the agreement between you and the vendor. The user
determines which purchase orders are to be printed by entering their numbers.  
  
The purchase order form includes information about all of the receipts which
have processed against it. Therefore, reprints run at a later date may not
look exactly like previous copies.

Purchase order forms may be printed as required and may be also be re-printed
at any time.
