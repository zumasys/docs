This is only stored if one of two conditions are met: 1) The parameters are set in [ CHANGE.CONTROL ](../../../../ACE-OVERVIEW/ACE-ENTRY/CHANGE-CONTROL/README.md) and a change was made that met the criteria for storing change history or 2) Change notes were entered by the user. This field is system controlled.   
  
**Change Time** The time the purchase order was changed. This is system
controlled.  
  
**Changed By** The User ID of the person who changed the purchase order. This
is system controlled.  
  
**Approved By** Enter the name or initials of the person who approved the
purchase order change.  
  
**Change Text** This is change text that is generated by the system based on the settings in [ CHANGE.CONTROL ](../../../../ACE-OVERVIEW/ACE-ENTRY/CHANGE-CONTROL/README.md) defining which fields trigger a change. Changes to those fields will be noted here. This text will also be included in purchase order change notices sent by email.

time. These notes will also be included in purchase order change notices sent
