[ Data Entry Procedures ](EXEC-ENTRY/README.md) | [ Reports and Inquiries ](EXEC-REPORT/README.md) | [ Update Processes ](EXEC-PROCESS/README.md)

**Purpose**  
The Executive Business Summary, while not considered a separate module,
retrieves information from other modules for the purpose of displaying summary
financial and inventory data.

**Prerequisites**  
The [ EXEC.CONTROL ](EXEC-ENTRY/EXEC-CONTROL/README.md) procedure should be used to enter any control parameters and/or amounts from outside the system which are to be considered in the processing. 

**Data Files**  
There is one primary data file which maintains the data directly accessed by the [ EXEC.Q ](EXEC-REPORT/EXEC-Q/README.md) procedure.   
  
The Executive file (EXEC) maintains one record for each date for which data is
generated.

**System Interface**  
Data is retrieved from the Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, General Ledger, Marketing and Purchasing modules. The normal flow of activities in those modules generates data which is used by the [ EXEC.P1 ](EXEC-REPORT/EXEC-Q/EXEC-P1/README.md) procedure. 

**User Interface**  
The user interface to the module consists of a data entry procedure to enter
control parameters and amounts external to the system which are to be
considered. Access to these procedures is controlled by the user's security
profile. Access to the batch procedure is usually restricted to use by only
the system administrator since these are usually run overnight.

**Setup Procedures**  
The [ EXEC.CONTROL ](EXEC-ENTRY/EXEC-CONTROL/README.md) procedure is the only setup process which may be performed prior to executing the [ EXEC.P1 ](EXEC-REPORT/EXEC-Q/EXEC-P1/README.md) process. 

**Flow of Activities**  
The information accessed, summarized and displayed in the [ EXEC.Q ](EXEC-REPORT/EXEC-Q/README.md) procedure is generated by each of the modules listed above. The [ EXEC.P1 ](EXEC-REPORT/EXEC-Q/EXEC-P1/README.md) procedure, when executed during the nighttime batch process, should be run after any batch posting or updating procedures in those modules.
