##  Executive Business Summary Report (EXEC.R1)

<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](EXEC-R1-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The EXEC.R1 procedure provides an report of a variety of financial and
business control figures. The intent is to provide the business executive with
a fast-access, concise look at the status of the company. All available
information is generated by date, normally on a nightly basis. The user may
enter one or more dates for which information has been generated.  
  
The Mtd/Ytd averages are a calculation of the monthly/yearly total divided by
the number of days within the month/year on which bookings/receipts/sales,
etc. actually occurred. For example, sales orders were only entered during the
month on 10 business days for a total of 12,000.00. The daily month-to-date
average would be = 12,000.00 / 10 days not 12,000.00 / 30 days.  
  
This information is also available via the [ EXEC.Q ](../EXEC-Q/README.md) inquiry. 

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.
