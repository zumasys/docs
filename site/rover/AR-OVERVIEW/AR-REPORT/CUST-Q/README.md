**Purpose**  
The CUST.Q procedure provides an on-line inquiry for a selected customer. The
inquiry includes information about the customers open balance, credit limit,
sales history, open orders, job status and A/R activity, contacts and the
contact log.  
  
The number of days of sales history which is displayed depends on parameters used when running [ SALES.P2 ](../../../MRK-OVERVIEW/MRK-PROCESS/SALES-P2/README.md) , a separate procedure that updates sales analysis data. Note that this update is normally setup as as part of the nightly batch processing.   
  
The number of days of A/R activity displayed depends on the setting in [ ACCT.CONTROL ](../../../AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/ACCT-CONTROL/README.md) .   
  
Information in CUST.Q is read-only data. You do have the ability to log transactions by using a button provided to add a new log transaction. Log transactions are stored in a separate data file. Customer data should be entered through the customer entry procedure ( [ CUST.E ](../../AR-ENTRY/CUST-E/README.md) )   

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
None.
