##  AR Collections Inquiry (AR.Q)

<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](AR-Q-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The AR.Q procedure is used to display a list of A/R items on a collections screen. The user may select to see items for a customer, by the number of days old, by the collection status code or the next action date. Once the AR items are on the screen, there is an open button that will invoke [ AR.E ](../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/ACCT-CONTROL/ACCT-CONTROL-3/AR-E) to make updates easier. 

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
The AR items must exist. Additionally, there are fields on the [ AR.E ](../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/ACCT-CONTROL/ACCT-CONTROL-3/AR-E) screen for collections that can help the user determine which AR items are to be displayed. If colleciton status codes are used, they can be pre-defined in [ ACCT.CONTROL ](../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/ACCT-CONTROL) .
