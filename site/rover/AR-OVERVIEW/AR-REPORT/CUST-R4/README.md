**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](CUST-R4-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The CUST.R4 report is used to provide a quick review of the credit status of
your customers. The report will tell you which customers are on credit hold,
what their credit limit and open balances are along with their average pay
days.  
  
You have multiple selection options when running this report. For example, you
can limit the report to customers with past due invoices so you can receive a
listing of customers to contact for payment status. You can, also, limit the
report to only customers with an open balance (A/R or sales order). You can
exclude customers on credit hold or only include customers on credit hold.
