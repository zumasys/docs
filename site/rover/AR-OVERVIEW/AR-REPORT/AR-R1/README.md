[ Form Details ](AR-R1-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The AR.R1 procedure is used to print an invoice register of invoices and
credit memos. The report selects all items issued for a selected period. The
report may be sorted either by AR item (invoice/memo number) or by date. This
sort option defaults based upon how the invoice number is assigned from
shipments. If the invoice is sequentially assigned, the option defaults to 'I'
(for AR item). If the shipment number is used as the AR item number, the
option defaults to 'D' (date).

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
None.
