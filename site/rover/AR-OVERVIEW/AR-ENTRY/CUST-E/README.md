**Purpose**  
The CUST.E procedure provides for the entry and maintenance of the Customer
Master file (CUST). The ID to each customer record is optionally assigned by
the user, or sequentially assigned by the system. Each record contains
descriptive information about the customer such as their name, address,
telephone and fax numbers, contact, discounts and default terms code. Many of
these data elements are used as defaults in the sales order entry and accounts
receivable procedures.

**Frequency of Use**  
Customers are usually loaded initially when the system is first installed,
with additions being made in the future as required.

**Prerequisites**  
Entry of terms records if they are to be referenced in the customer records ( [ TERMS.E ](../../../AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/TERMS-E/README.md) ). All valid sales tax codes must be entered via the [ STAX.E ](../STAX-E/README.md) procedure.
