This is only stored if one of two conditions are met: 1) The parameters are set in [ CHANGE.CONTROL ](../../../../ACE-OVERVIEW/ACE-ENTRY/CHANGE-CONTROL/README.md) and a change was made that met the criteria for storing change history or 2) Change notes were entered by the user. This field is system controlled and cannot be changed.   
  
**Change Time** The time the customer record was changed. This field is system
controlled and cannot be changed.  
  
**Changed By** The User ID of the person who changed the customer record. This
field is system controlled and cannot be changed.  
  
**Approved By** Enter the name or initials of the person who approved the
customer change.  
  
**Change Text** This is change text that is generated by the system based on the settings in [ CHANGE.CONTROL ](../../../../ACE-OVERVIEW/ACE-ENTRY/CHANGE-CONTROL/README.md) defining which fields trigger a change. Changes to those fields will be noted here. This text will also be included in customer change notices sent by email.
