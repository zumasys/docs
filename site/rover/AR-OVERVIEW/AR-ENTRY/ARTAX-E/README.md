##  Update ARTAX Records (ARTAX.E)

<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](ARTAX-E-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The ARTAX.E procedure is used to modify AR tax records which were created
through the AR module. Extreme caution should be exercised when using this
process. Changing of amount, dates and account number has a direct effect on
what information is reported on the sales tax return reports.  
  
The main purpose of this procedure is to allow changes to records which were created incorrectly through accounts receivable and for which no correction is possible through the normal AR data entry procedures. An example of this is the filing of an item in [ AR.E ](../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/ACCT-CONTROL/ACCT-CONTROL-3/AR-E) with the wrong tax data for a period which is already closed.   
  
Updates are not allowed to records whHich have already been posted.

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
Records must exist as created from accounts receivable.
