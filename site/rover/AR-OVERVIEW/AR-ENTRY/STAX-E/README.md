**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](STAX-E-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The STAX.E procedure is used to define the various sales tax codes which will
be used in processing Sales Orders and Accounts Receivable transactions. Each
record specifies a description of the code, a definition of local or state
tax, a General Ledger account number and a sales tax percent.

**Frequency of Use**  
Sales Tax codes are usually defined when the system is being setup prior to
any transaction processing. New codes may be added at any time, but care must
be taken when existing codes are changed which are referenced by other records
in the system.

**Prerequisites**  
The General Ledger account must exist in the GLCHART file.
