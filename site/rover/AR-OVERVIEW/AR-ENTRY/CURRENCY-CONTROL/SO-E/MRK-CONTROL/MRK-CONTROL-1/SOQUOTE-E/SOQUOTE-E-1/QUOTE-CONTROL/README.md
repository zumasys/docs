**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](QUOTE-CONTROL-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The QUOTE.CONTROL procedure is used to define default information and option
settings which will be used by the quote entry procedures. The information
entered in this procedure is loaded into the corresponding fields on new
quotes so that the same information does not have to be entered on every sales
order. The user has the option of changing any of these defaults on the quote
after they are loaded.

**Frequency of Use**  
The entries in this procedure must be loaded prior to using any of the quote
procedures. This is usually done as part of setting up the system. The entries
may be changed after that time as required.

**Prerequisites**  
None.
