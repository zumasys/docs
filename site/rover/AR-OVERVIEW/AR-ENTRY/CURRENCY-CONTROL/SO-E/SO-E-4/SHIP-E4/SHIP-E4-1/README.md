**Shipment Number** Shipment numbers are assigned automatically by the system
when the record is filed. If you are creating a new shipment you should leave
this prompt blank. If you want to make a change to an existing shipment you
should enter the full shipment record ID. The ID of a shipment record is made
up of the sales order number followed by a sequential number maintained for
each sales order. For example, the first shipment for sales order 123 would be
123-1, the second 123-2 etc.  
  
**Status** The status field contains the current status of the shipment
record. It will display one of the following codes:  
N - The items have not been shipped.  
S - The items have been shipped.  
P - The shipment has been posted and the accounts receivable record has been
created.  
If the status code is not already set to "P" then the user may enter the code "N" for new, or "S" for shipped. The "N" status sets the shipment as a new shipment just as the [ SHIP.E ](../../../../../../../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/AP-E/AP-E-1/CURRENCY-CONTROL/SO-E/SO-E-4/SHIP-E) procedure does, and does not create any inventory transactions. The "S" status will confirm the shipment by creating inventory transactions, and will be posted the next time the procedure [ SHIP.P1 ](../../../../../../../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/ACCT-CONTROL/ACCT-CONTROL-1/comm-e/SHIP-P1) is run.
