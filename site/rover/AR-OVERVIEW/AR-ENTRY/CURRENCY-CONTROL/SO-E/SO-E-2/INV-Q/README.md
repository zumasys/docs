**Purpose**  
The INV.Q procedure provides an inquiry of the status of inventory by part
number. The user may specify a part number or they may enter any of the parts
file cross-reference items which include model number, category, and
manufacturer part number. If these are entered the system will automatically
substitute the corresponding part number, or display a list of possible part
numbers which can be chosen. Once a part has been entered the system will
display all of the assembly part numbers on which it is referenced.  
  
The information displayed includes the on hand balance and on order for each
location, shortage information, usage history, lot information, allocations,
commitments and open order information.  
  
There is, also, a tab to display the inventory transaction history for the part number for a selected number of days. In the [ INV.CONTROL ](../../../../../../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/AP-E/AP-E-2/INV-CONTROL) procedure, there is a field that controls how may days of transaction history will be viewed in this procedure. Transactions created prior to that point can still be viewed by running the inventory transaction reports. The inventory transaction reports can be found in the report section of the inventory module and begin with the term IT.R. 

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**
