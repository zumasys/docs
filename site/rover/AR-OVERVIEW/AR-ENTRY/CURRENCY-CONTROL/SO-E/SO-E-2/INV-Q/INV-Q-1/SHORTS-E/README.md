[ Change History ](SHORTS-E-2/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The SHORTS.E procedure is used to directly change the shortage information for
a specified part number. The user enters the number of the part to be changed.
If there is currently no shortage for the part then a new record will be
created. The user may then add or remove work orders and change the quantities
associated to those work orders. There is also a notes field which may be used
to enter information about the status of the shortage. These notes are printed
on the shortage report.

**Frequency of Use**  
Except for entering notes you would normally not be required to make changes
to the shortage records since the creation and deletion of these records are
handled automatically by other processes. The procedure is normally used for
special circumstances where an unforseen situation has occurred.

**Prerequisites**  
None.
