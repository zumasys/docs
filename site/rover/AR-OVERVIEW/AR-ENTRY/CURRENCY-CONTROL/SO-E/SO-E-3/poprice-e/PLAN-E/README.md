##  Release Planned Orders (PLAN.E)

<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](PLAN-E-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The PLAN.E procedure provides the production planner with an automated method
of creating work orders and purchase orders from master schedule items in MPS
or from planned orders generated by MRP. The procedure provides several
options to limit the items displayed for release such as planner, category,
make part, buy part, planned order and master schedule. The planner has the
option of release all of the items as displayed, or may make adjustments to
specific items before they are released.  
  
The planner will not be able to create purchase orders for parts on "buy hold" or work orders for parts on "make hold". The buy hold and make hold options are updated in the [ PARTS.E ](../../../../../../../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/ACCT-CONTROL/ACCT-CONTROL-1/ar-e/PARTS-E) procedure. 

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
The [ MRP.P1 ](MRP-P1/README.md) procedure must be run if planned orders are to be released.
