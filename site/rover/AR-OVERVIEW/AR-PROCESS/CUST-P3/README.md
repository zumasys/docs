[ Form Details ](CUST-P3-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The purpose of CUST.P3 to update the inactive date field in the customer record or [ CUST.E ](../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/ACCT-CONTROL/ACCT-CONTROL-1/ar-e/CUST-E) . The customers that will be selected are those with no sales orders, invoices or quotes created on or after the cutoff date. The user running this procedure selects the cutoff date to be used.   
  
There is an option to exclude customers based on the customer date. The customer date field is defined in [ CUST.E ](../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/ACCT-CONTROL/ACCT-CONTROL-1/ar-e/CUST-E) and tells the system what date you first started doing business with the customer.
