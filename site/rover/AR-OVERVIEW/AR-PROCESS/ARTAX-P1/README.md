**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](ARTAX-P1-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The ARTAX.P1 procedure is used to flag all eligible ARTAX records with a
selected post date. This date will reflect when the sales tax reports have
been printed and the sales tax return prepared. In this way, if AR records are
later posted into a previous period, it will be possible to determine which
ARTAX items have already been reported and which are new for a period.

**Frequency of Use**  
This procedure is normally used when a sales tax reporting period is closed
and returns are prepared.

**Prerequisites**  
ARTAX records must exist.
