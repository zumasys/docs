change on the ECN is enacted. The current revision from the routing will be

carry after the change on the ECN is implemented. The system will attempt to
determine the next revision level automatically.

**Action**|  Select the way in which the change to the routing is to be
performed.

Phase In - Indicates that an existing item is to be changed or a new item is
to be added based on the effectivity date and retains the original information
so that you can run a routing report as of a specified date and see what it
looked like at that point in time.

Phase Out - Indicates that an existing item is to be removed based on the
effectivity date and retains the original information so that you can run a
routing report as of a specified date and see what it looked like at that
point in time.

Add - Adds a new item that is not based on the effectivity date which
therefore becomes active immediately.

Change - Changes the information on an existing line without retaining
history.

Delete - Removes the information on an existing item without retaining
history.
