**Purpose**
The FSO.E2 procedure is used to reverse existing field service records which
have already been posted. The user enters the number of the FSO to be reversed
and the data from the field service order is displayed for review but may not
be changed. When the record is filed inventory transactions are created to
move any parts used back into inventory. The reversal will be posted by the
[FSO.P1](../FSO-P1/README.md) procedure and a credit memo will be created in the
Accounts Receivable system.

**Frequency of Use**
As required.

**Prerequisites**
Existing field service order must be already posted.
