batch process queues available in the list that allow you to submit the job
for processing in the background or at a predefined time such as overnight. A
system printer must be specified when using these queues.

formats depends on what is allowed by each procedure. Possible formats include

appropriate setting in this field. Set the value to Portrait if the page is to
be oriented with the shorter dimension (usually 8.5 inches) at the top or

Portrait will always be available but Landscape is dependent on the output
destination and may not be available in all cases.
