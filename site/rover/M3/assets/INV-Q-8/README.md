## Transactions

![](./INV-Q-8.jpg)

| **Trans Date**|  This field contains the transaction date. This is usually
the same as the date that the transaction was processed on. However, in
certain procedures ([SHIP.E2](../SHIP-E2/README.md), [RECEIPTS.E](../RECEIPTS-E/README.md)), the
transaction date can be changed to a date other than the current date.
Therefore, it is possible to process a transaction on 9/16/09 but date it
9/1/09. The date that appears in this field would be 9/1/09. The transaction
detail lookup will display the date and time the transaction was processed on.
