**Purpose**
The WC.E procedure is used to enter new work centers into the work center file
(WC), change existing records and delete records from the file. The record ID
of the work center is defined by the user and should conform to a naming
convention defined in advance.

The information contained in each record consists of a description, crew size,
the standard hours for the work center including pre-operation, post
operation, setup and run hours, and percentages for fixed and variable
overhead calculations and rate. Capacity for the work center is also defined
in this procedure.

A work center cannot be deleted if it is referenced on a routing or open work
order record.

**Frequency of Use**
As required.

**Prerequisites**
None.
