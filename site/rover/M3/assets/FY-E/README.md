## G/L Fiscal Date Entry (FY.E)
<PageHeader />

**Form Details**
[Form Details](../FY-E-1/README.md)

**Purpose**
The FY.E procedure is used to enter fiscal year information which will define
the periods to be used by the general ledger module. One record must be
defined for each fiscal year, keyed by the letters 'FY' followed by the four
digit year (e.g. FY1991). The periods are completely user defined and there
may be any number of periods defined for a fiscal year. After the entry of
each period's end date, the start date of the next period is automatically
defaulted. The one restriction is that each period start must be the day after
the prior period's end date.

**Frequency of Use**
When first implementing the general ledger module, all fiscal years for which
history will be entered and the current fiscal year must be created. Prior to
closing a fiscal year, the next year must be defined.

**Prerequisites**
None.
