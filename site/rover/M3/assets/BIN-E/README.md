## Reference Bin Location Entry (BIN.E)
<PageHeader />

**Form Details**
[Bins](../BIN-E-1/README.md)
[Change History](../BIN-E-2/README.md)

**Purpose**
The BIN.E procedure is used to enter reference bin locations for a given part
at different locations. You may enter one or more bin locations for the part
within each inventory location. The purpose of bin locations is to assist the
stockroom personnel in finding the location of parts within the warehouse. Bin
locations are displayed on the inventory inquiry screen and the work order
picking list.

Another way in which bin locations are added to the system is through the
inventory transaction procedure ([IT.E](../IT-E/README.md)). It allows you to specify
the bin location at which the parts were stored after they were moved. An
example of this would be when parts are moved from receiving inspection to the
stockroom. This avoids the need to enter those bins in this procedure.

**Frequency of Use**
As required.

**Prerequisites**
Entry of valid inventory locations ([INVLOC.E](../INVLOC-E/README.md)) and parts
records ([PARTS.E](../PARTS-E/README.md)).
