marketing campaign. A marketing campaign may include multiple steps such as
mailings, emails and follow-up calls which can be noted in the campaign

customer and prospect master files based on the group codes with which they
have been associated. These master file records can then be posted with the
campaign id for tracking purposes. In addition, you have the ability to export
the customers and/or prospects identified to an Excel spreadsheet for use in
mailmerge or other activities related to the campaign.

As required.

**Prerequisites**
If group codes are to be used for determining which customers and prospects
are to be included in a campaign they must forst be defined in the
[GROUP.CONTROL](../GROUP-CONTROL/README.md) procedure and referenced on each customer
or prospect.
