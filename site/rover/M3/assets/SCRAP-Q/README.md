<PageHeader />

**Form Details**
[Form Details](../SCRAP-Q-1/README.md)

**Purpose**
The SCRAP.Q procedure provides an inquiry of the production scrap, as recorded
by [ST.E3](../ST-E3/README.md), by monthly periods in bar chart format

The user controls how many periods are displayed by entering the start month
and year and end month and year. The screen initially defaults to the last 12
full months. There are options to show scrap only or scrap and completions. A
work order completion in this sense is any quantity moved out of a work
center. There is also an option to show the data in terms of quantity,
dollars, or percent and to group the data by work center or user id. There is
a summary chart that displays all work centers' or users' data grouped
together.

**Frequency of Use**
As required.

**Prerequisites**
None.
