## Enter Recurring G/L Transactions (GLRECUR.E)
<PageHeader />

**Form Details**
[Form Details](../GLRECUR-E-1/README.md)

**Purpose**
This procedure provides a means for automatically generating journal entries
that must be entered every period. Its layout is similar to the standard
journal entry procedure [GLTRANS.E](../GLTRANS-E/README.md) except for the addition of
prompts that identify the time period for which the journals are to be created
and on what day of the period. Entries are created in the GLTRANS file by
running the procedure [GLRECUR.P1](../GLRECUR-P1/README.md), typically at the end of
each period.

**Frequency of Use**
As required.

**Prerequisites**
Entry of general ledger account numbers through [GLCHART.E](../GLCHART-E/README.md).
