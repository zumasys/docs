| **Job ID**|  Enter a unique ID if you wish to enter and save the parameters
to this procedure for future use. If you only need to run the procedure and do
not want to save your entry then you may leave this field empty.

-  
**Destination**|  Select the destination for the output from this procedure.

**Process**|  Select the method to be used for processing the report.
Foreground is always available and must be used when output is directed to
anything other than a system printer (i.e. printers spooled through the
database on the host computer.) Depending on your setup there may be various
batch process queues available in the list that allow you to submit the job
for processing in the background or at a predefined time such as overnight. A
system printer must be specified when using these queues.

**Format**|  Select the format for the output. The availability of other
formats depends on what is allowed by each procedure. Possible formats include
Text, Excel, Word, PDF, HTML, Comma delimited and Tab delimited.

**Layout**|  You may indicate the layout of the printed page by specifying the
appropriate setting in this field. Set the value to Portrait if the page is to
be oriented with the shorter dimension (usually 8.5 inches) at the top or
Landscape if the longer dimension (usually 11 inches) is to be at the top.
Portrait will always be available but Landscape is dependent on the output
destination and may not be available in all cases.

**Copies**|  Enter the number of copies to be printed.

**Run Process**|  Click on the button to run the process. This performs the
save function which may also be activated by clicking the save button in the
tool bar or pressing the F9 key or Ctrl+S.

**Model Number**|  Enter the model number you want to use to produce the
report or leave this field blank to include all model numbers in the listing.
You may enter only those models for which failure data has been collected as
defined in the [MTBF.CONTROL](../MTBF-CONTROL/README.md) procedure. Depending on how
the models were defined you may be required to enter only a portion of the
model number such as a prefix rather than the specific model number.

**Time Period (in months)**|  Enter the number of months of history to be
included in the listing.

**Through Month**|  Enter the month of the year to be used as the last period
of history. For example, if you wanted to list the failures based on the 36
month period ending 5-30-90, you would have entered 36 as the time period, 5
for the month of May in this field and 90 for the year 1990 in the next field.
You may also leave this field blank which will cause the system to use the
latest period available.

**Through Year**|  Enter the year to be used as the last history period. For
example, if you wanted to list the failures for the 36 month period ending
5-30-90, you would have entered 36 as the time period, 5 for the month of May
in previous field and 90 for the year 1990 in the this field. You may also
leave the field blank so that the system will use the latest period available.

**Last Status Message**|  Contains the last status message generated by the
program.

**Last Status Date**|  The date on which the last status message was
generated.

**Last Status Time**|  The time at which the last status message was
generated.
