## End All Current Jobs (EMPTIME.P2)
<PageHeader />

**Form Details**
[Form Details](../EMPTIME-P2-1/README.md)

**Purpose**
This procedure is used for logging all employees out of the jobs they are
currently logged into. This would replace the use of
[EMPTIME.E4](../EMPTIME-E4/README.md) and could be used in situations such as fire-
drills, a power outage that suspends all work, or sudden plant closure. It
produces a report of all employees and jobs that were logged out.

**Frequency of Use**
As required.

**Prerequisites**
Employee information must be entered using the [EMP.E](../EMP-E/README.md) procedure
and control parameters must be defined in the [LABOR.CONTROL](../LABOR-
CONTROL/README.md) procedure.
