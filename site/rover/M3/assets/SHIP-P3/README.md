that can then be processed by the freight carrier's software system. This
procedure allows for the selection of a date range or selected shipment
records. The data is sent to a file/folder which is selected by the user. The
default is maintained in [SHIP.CONTROL](../SHIP-CONTROL/README.md).

**Frequency of Use**
As required.

**Prerequisites**
The [SHIP.CONTROL](../SHIP-CONTROL/README.md) procedure can be used to define valid
ship methods and freight carriers, as well as default locations for the export
file.
