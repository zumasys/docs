## Manufacturing Calendar (MC.CONTROL)
<PageHeader />

**Form Details**
[Form Details](../MC-CONTROL-1/README.md)

**Purpose**
The MC.CONTROL procedure is used to define the manufacturing calendar. You
define the calendar in terms of standard work days of the week, holiday dates
and non-standard work days. The holiday and non-standard work days should be
defined far enough into the future to cover the normal product lead times
which may be present. Old dates may be removed at any time.

**Frequency of Use**
If you intend to use the scheduling features of the work order entry procedure
you must setup the calendar out to a reasonable time frame. The frequency at
which you must update the calendar depends upon how far into the future it is
was previously defined.

**Prerequisites**
None.
