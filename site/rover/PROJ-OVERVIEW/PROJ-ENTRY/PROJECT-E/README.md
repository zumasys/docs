**Purpose**  
PROJECT.E is the starting point for the project system. It is the method used
to define a project and various tasks associated with the project. Information
defined in a project includes the date it was created, a title and description
and an optional reference to a customer. Also defined are each of the tasks
associated with the project including a task title and description, as well as
scheduled start and end dates and budgets for cost and revenue. You may
associate a project to another project by specifying the parent project number
and task to which it is linked. This creates a parent child relationship
between projects which can extend an unlimited number of levels.

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
None.
