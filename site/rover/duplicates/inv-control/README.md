<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](../../INV-OVERVIEW/INV-ENTRY/INV-CONTROL/INV-CONTROL-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The INV.CONTROL procedure is used to define default information which will be
used by the inventory entry procedures. Also, it defines locations and General
Ledger account numbers used by the Product Costing, Physical and Cycle
Inventory portions of the module. The Cycle Count process utilizes the
information entered in this screen to assign cycle count dates in the
Inventory file.

**Frequency of Use**  
The entries in this procedure must be loaded prior to using any of the other
procedures in the Inventory Module. This is usually done as part of setting up
the system. The entries may be changed after that time as required.

**Prerequisites**  
The inventory locations must have been previously defined in the Inventory Location file ( [ INVLOC.E ](../../INV-OVERVIEW/INV-ENTRY/INVLOC-E/README.md) ).   
The General Ledger account number must have been previously defined in the chart of accounts ( [ GLCHART.E ](../../GL-OVERVIEW/GL-ENTRY/GLCHART-E/README.md) ).
