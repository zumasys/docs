**Purpose**  
The PO.E procedure is used to enter new purchase orders into the system and to
change existing purchase orders. The procedure consists of two screens. One
contains the header information such as vendor, contact and payment terms. The
other contains the information about what is being purchased, such as part
number, date and quantity due, and unit price. The system allows you to enter
multiple sets of the data (line items) on the second screen. You may also
enter multiple delivery dates and quantities for each line item.  
  
Purchase orders may be deleted provided that no receipts have been entered
against the purchase order. Changes to the scheduled dates and quantities may
be made after a receipt provided that the quantity is not reduced below the
amount received.

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
Initialization of the purchase order control record ( [ PO.CONTROL ](../../../../../../../../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/AP-E/AP-E-1/CURRENCY-CONTROL/PO-E/PO-E-2/PO-CONTROL) ), and entry of the vendor and terms records to be referenced.
