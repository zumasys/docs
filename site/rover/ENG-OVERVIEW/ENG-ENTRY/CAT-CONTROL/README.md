##  Define Valid Categories (CAT.CONTROL)

<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ ](CAT-CONTROL-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The CAT.CONTROL procedure is used to define the valid category codes which may be used within the parts entry procedure. When this procedure contains data, the valid entries are loaded into the category drop down list. If this screen is left empty, then the user will be able to put any category into [ PARTS.E ](../../../../../../../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/ACCT-CONTROL/ACCT-CONTROL-1/ar-e/PARTS-E) .   
  
If changes are made to the CAT.CONTROL entries, the user must exit, then re-enter the [ PARTS.E ](../../../../../../../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/ACCT-CONTROL/ACCT-CONTROL-1/ar-e/PARTS-E) procedure for the changes to take effect. 

**Frequency of Use**  
These entries are usually entered when the system is first being setup since
they are required before some other procedures may be used. After the initial
setup it is used as required to add new codes.

**Prerequisites**  
None.
