##  Valid Specifications (SPEC.CONTROL)

<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](SPEC-CONTROL-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The SPEC.CONTROL procedure is used to define a master list of specifications (specs) which may be used when updating the master parts file. If any specifications are entered in this procedure, the data entry in [ PARTS.E ](../../../../../../../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/ACCT-CONTROL/ACCT-CONTROL-1/ar-e/PARTS-E) is limited to that list. If there are no specifications entered, any specs will be allowed in the [ PARTS.E ](../../../../../../../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/ACCT-CONTROL/ACCT-CONTROL-1/ar-e/PARTS-E) procedure. 

**Frequency of Use**  
The entries in this procedure should be loaded prior to entering part numbers in the [ PARTS.E ](../../../../../../../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/ACCT-CONTROL/ACCT-CONTROL-1/ar-e/PARTS-E) procedure. This will help eliminate data entry errors during parts creation. Entries may be added or removed as required. 

**Prerequisites**  
None.
