[ Form Details ](BAR-CONTROL-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
BAR.CONTROL is used to define the behavior of several shop/floor and time and
attendance procedures designed for use with bar code wedge devices. When using
bar code devices it is sometimes desirable for the transaction to be saved
automatically after the last bar code entry and to exit the procedure. You can
set both of these parameters for each procedure defined.

**Frequency of Use**  
Usually at initial system setup, or when changes are required.

**Prerequisites**  
None.
