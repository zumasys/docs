##  Cost Control Entry (COST.CONTROL)

<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Cost Control Parameters ](COST-CONTROL-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The COST.CONTROL procedure maintains the material overhead amounts used by the cost rollup procedure ( [ COST.P1 ](../../ENG-PROCESS/COST-P1/README.md) ) and the default labor overhead amounts used by the work center entry procedure ( [ WC.E ](../../../PRO-OVERVIEW/PRO-ENTRY/WC-E/README.md) ). If a work center in a routing does not specify one of the overhead amounts then the labor defaults are used by the cost rollup procedure. 

**Frequency of Use**  
Usually entered when the system is first setup, but may be changed as
required.

**Prerequisites**  
None.
