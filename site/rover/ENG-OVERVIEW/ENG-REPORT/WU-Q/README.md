[ Form Details ](WU-Q-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The WU.Q procedure is an inquiry used to determine on which assemblies a given
part number is referenced. The user may specify a part number or he may enter
any of the parts file cross-reference items which include model number,
category, and manufacturer part number. If these are entered the system will
automatically substitute the corresponding part number, or display a list of
possible part numbers which can be chosen. Once a part has been entered the
system will display all of the assembly part numbers on which it is
referenced.

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
Building the Where Used file ( [ WU.P1 ](../../../../rover/ENG-OVERVIEW/ENG-PROCESS/WU-P1/README.md) ).
