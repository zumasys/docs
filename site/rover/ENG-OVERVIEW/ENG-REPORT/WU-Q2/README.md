[ Form Details ](WU-Q2-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The WU.Q2 procedure is an inquiry used to determine on which end item
assemblies a given part number is ultimately used. The user may specify a part
number or may enter any of the parts file cross-reference items which include
model number, category, and manufacturer part number. If these are entered the
system will automatically substitute the corresponding part number, or display
a list of possible part numbers which can be chosen. Once a part has been
entered the system will display all of the end item assembly part numbers on
which it is used. Only end item assembly numbers will be listed.

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
Building the Where Used file ( [ WU.P1 ](../../../../rover/ENG-OVERVIEW/ENG-PROCESS/WU-P1) ).
