codes, quantities and reference designators. You may also compare a bill of
material to itself at different points in time by entering the same bill of
material number at both prompts with different effectivity dates. The report
will include each item on the bill of materials that are different from one
another based on the criteria entered. A line of asterisks (*) will appear
beneath each element that is different.
