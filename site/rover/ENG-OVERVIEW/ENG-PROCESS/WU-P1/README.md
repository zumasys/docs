##  Where Used Update (WU.P1)

<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](WU-P1-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The WU.P1 procedure clears and rebuilds the Where Used file (WU) based on the
data in the Bill of Material file.

**Frequency of Use**  
Where used information is updated automatically when changes are made with the [ BOM.E ](../../ENG-ENTRY/BOM-E/README.md) procedure. You will need to run this procedure if bill of material data was loaded from a conversion data from another system or if you determine that a corruption of the where used file (WU) has occurred.

**Prerequisites**  
Entry of Parts records ( [ PARTS.E ](../../ENG-ENTRY/PARTS-E/README.md) ) and Bill of Material records ( [ BOM.E ](../../ENG-ENTRY/BOM-E/README.md) ).
