# Go-Live and Support

<PageHeader />

This final module covers the critical go-live phase and post-implementation support considerations for successful AP module deployment.

## Pre-Go-Live Checklist

### System Readiness
- [ ] All configuration completed and tested
- [ ] User training completed and validated
- [ ] Data migration executed and verified
- [ ] Integration testing completed successfully
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested
- [ ] Performance testing under load

### Data Validation
- [ ] Vendor master file complete and accurate
- [ ] Open AP items migrated correctly
- [ ] Terms and account setups validated
- [ ] Check numbering sequence configured
- [ ] Historical data archived appropriately

### User Preparation
- [ ] All users trained and certified
- [ ] Reference materials distributed
- [ ] Support contacts established
- [ ] Emergency procedures documented
- [ ] Backup personnel identified and trained

### Process Validation
- [ ] End-to-end transaction testing completed
- [ ] Approval workflows tested and validated
- [ ] Reporting functions verified
- [ ] Integration points tested
- [ ] Exception handling procedures tested

## Go-Live Strategy

### Phased Implementation (Recommended)
**Week 1:** Limited pilot group with close supervision
**Week 2:** Expand to full AP department
**Week 3:** Full production with monitoring
**Week 4:** Normal operations with periodic check-ins

### Parallel Processing
- Run new system alongside old system for limited period
- Compare results and resolve discrepancies
- Gradual transition of responsibilities
- Maintain old system as backup initially

### Direct Cutover
- Complete switch on specific date
- Higher risk but faster transition
- Requires extensive preparation and testing
- Recommended only for simple implementations

## Go-Live Execution

### Day 1 Activities
- [ ] Final system backup before go-live
