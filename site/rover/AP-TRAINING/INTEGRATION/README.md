# Integration Points

<PageHeader />

This module covers key integration points between the AP module and other Rover ERP modules, as well as external systems. Proper integration setup is critical for seamless data flow and process automation.

## General Ledger Integration

### Automatic GL Posting

The AP module automatically creates general ledger entries for:
- **Invoice entries:** Debit expense accounts, credit AP liability
- **Payment processing:** Debit AP liability, credit cash account  
- **Discount taken:** Credit discount account
- **Adjustments:** Various account impacts based on transaction type

### GL Interface Configuration

#### Real-Time vs. Batch Posting
**Real-Time:** Immediate GL impact upon AP transaction save
- Pros: Current GL balances, immediate reporting
- Cons: Higher system load, potential performance impact

**Batch Processing:** GL entries created during batch processing
- Pros: Better performance, controlled timing
- Cons: Delayed GL updates, reconciliation timing

### Account Validation

#### Strict Validation
- Only valid, active GL accounts accepted
- Prevents posting to incorrect accounts
- Requires complete chart of accounts setup

#### Warning-Only Validation  
- Allows posting to any account with warning
- More flexible for quick entries
- Risk of posting to wrong accounts

## Purchase Order Integration

### Three-Way Matching Process

The integration between PO, receiving, and AP modules enables automated matching:

1. **Purchase Order Creation:** Establishes expected receipts
2. **Receipt Processing:** Creates accrual entries in AP
3. **Invoice Matching:** Matches vendor invoices to receipts
4. **Variance Resolution:** Handles differences in price/quantity

### Receipt-to-AP Processing

#### Automatic Accrual Creation
When goods are received:
```
DR: Inventory or Expense Account
CR: AP Accrual Account
```

#### Invoice Matching Process
When vendor invoice received:
- Match to existing accrual entry
- Adjust for price variances
- Complete payment authorization

### Configuration Requirements

- **Account Setup:** Accrual accounts for different item types
- **Variance Accounts:** Price and quantity variance posting
- **Approval Workflows:** Integration with PO approval limits
- **Tolerance Settings:** Acceptable variance percentages

## Inventory Integration

### Direct Inventory Purchases

For items purchased directly for inventory:
- **Receipt Processing:** Updates inventory quantities and costs
- **Invoice Processing:** Adjusts costs based on actual invoice
- **Cost Variances:** Posted to appropriate variance accounts

### Integration with Cost Accounting

#### Standard Cost Environment
- Purchase price variances calculated automatically
- Posted to designated variance accounts
- Cost roll-up procedures for manufactured items

#### Average Cost Environment
- Costs updated based on actual purchase prices
- Weighted average calculations
- Impact on inventory valuation

## Multi-Company Processing

### Consolidated AP Processing

For organizations with multiple legal entities:

#### Centralized Processing
- Single AP department processes for all companies
- Intercompany entries for cross-company transactions
- Consolidated reporting and analysis

#### Decentralized Processing
- Each company maintains separate AP function
- Standardized procedures across companies
- Roll-up reporting capabilities

### Configuration Considerations

- **Chart of Accounts:** Consistent numbering across companies
- **Vendor Setup:** Shared vendor files vs. company-specific
- **Approval Workflows:** Company-specific approval hierarchies
- **Reporting:** Company and consolidated views

## External System Integration

### EDI Processing

Electronic Data Interchange for supplier invoices:

#### Inbound Invoice Processing
- Receive EDI invoices from suppliers
- Automatic data validation and posting
- Exception handling for errors

#### Outbound Payment Processing  
- Generate EDI payment notifications
- Electronic fund transfer integration
- Payment status tracking

### Banking Integration

#### Electronic Payment Files
- ACH file generation for electronic payments
- Wire transfer processing
- Payment confirmation receipt

#### Bank Reconciliation
- Electronic bank statement import
- Automatic check clearing updates
- Exception identification and resolution

### Document Management Integration

#### Invoice Imaging
- Scan and attach invoice images to AP records
- Workflow routing for approvals
- Document retention and retrieval

#### Electronic Approval
- Digital signature capture
- Audit trail maintenance
- Mobile approval capabilities

## Implementation Best Practices

### Planning Phase
- Map all integration points early in project
- Identify data dependencies between modules
- Plan testing scenarios for integrated processes

### Configuration Phase
- Set up integration accounts in GL
- Configure interface parameters
- Test integration scenarios thoroughly

### Testing Phase
- End-to-end transaction testing
- Verify GL postings and balances
- Test exception handling procedures

### Go-Live Phase
- Monitor integration processes closely
- Address issues quickly
- Maintain backup procedures

## Common Integration Issues

### Issue: GL Interface Errors
**Symptoms:** Transactions don't post to general ledger
**Solutions:**
- Verify GL account validity
- Check interface configuration
- Review error logs for specific issues

### Issue: PO Matching Problems
**Symptoms:** Cannot match invoices to receipts
**Solutions:**
- Verify PO and receipt data accuracy
- Check matching tolerances
- Review vendor and item number consistency

### Issue: Multi-Company Postings
**Symptoms:** Transactions post to wrong company
**Solutions:**
- Verify company assignments in setup
- Check user security and company access
- Review intercompany account configurations
