## Training Guide Overview

This guide covers the complete implementation process for the Rover ERP Accounts Payable module, from initial setup through go-live and ongoing support. It is structured to provide implementation engineers with practical, field-tested guidance based on real customer implementations.

**Target Audience:** Implementation engineers, system administrators, and technical consultants responsible for Rover ERP AP module deployments.

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic understanding of accounting principles and accounts payable processes
- Familiarity with Rover ERP system architecture
- Completed General Ledger module implementation (required dependency)
- Access to customer's existing AP procedures and vendor setup

## Training Modules

| Module | Description | Estimated Time |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| [Setup and Configuration](SETUP/README.md) | Initial AP module setup, control records, and basic configuration | 2-3 hours |
| [Vendor Management](VENDOR-SETUP/README.md) | Vendor file setup, terms configuration, and data migration | 1-2 hours |
| [Data Entry Procedures](DATA-ENTRY/README.md) | AP entry processes, recurring items, and workflow setup | 2-4 hours |
| [Payment Processing](PAYMENTS/README.md) | Check processing, payment runs, and approval workflows | 2-3 hours |
| [Integration Points](INTEGRATION/README.md) | GL integration, PO matching, and system interfaces | 1-2 hours |
| [Reporting and Inquiries](REPORTING/README.md) | Standard reports, custom queries, and management dashboards | 1-2 hours |
| [Common Issues and Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING/README.md) | Field-tested solutions for common implementation challenges | 1 hour |
| [Go-Live and Support](GO-LIVE/README.md) | Final preparation, cutover procedures, and post-implementation support | 2-3 hours |

## Implementation Methodology

### Phase 1: Discovery and Planning (Week 1)
- Review customer's current AP processes
- Identify integration requirements
- Document vendor setup and payment procedures
- Plan data migration strategy

### Phase 2: System Configuration (Week 2-3)
- Configure AP control records
- Set up vendor master files
- Configure payment terms and approval workflows
- Establish GL integration points

### Phase 3: Testing and Training (Week 4-5)
- Conduct system testing with sample data
- Train end users on AP procedures
- Validate reporting and inquiry functions
- Test integration with other modules

### Phase 4: Data Migration and Go-Live (Week 6)
- Migrate vendor and open AP data
- Execute parallel processing period
- Go-live with production processing
- Monitor and support initial operations

## Key Success Factors

1. **Thorough Discovery:** Understanding the customer's existing processes is critical for successful configuration
2. **Data Quality:** Clean vendor data and proper GL account mapping are essential
3. **User Training:** End users must be comfortable with new procedures before go-live
4. **Testing:** Comprehensive testing prevents issues in production
5. **Change Management:** Proper communication and support during transition
