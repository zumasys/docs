# Foundational Transaction Flows
<PageHeader />

Rover ERP's foundational transaction flows demonstrate how information moves through the platform's core business processes. They connect quoting to invoicing, purchasing to payment, and planning to receipt so that new users and internal teams can see how work transitions across modules.

These guides show each process end-to-end and highlight the modules, screens, and controls used to keep transactions moving.

## Available Flows
- [Sales: Quote-to-Cash](./quote-to-cash/README.md)
- [Purchasing: Procure-to-Payment](./procure-to-payment/README.md)
- [Planning: Material Planning → PO → Receipt](./material-planning-po-to-receipt/README.md)
