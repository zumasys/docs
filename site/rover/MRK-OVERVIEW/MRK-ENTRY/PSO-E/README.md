**Form Details**  
[ Order Information ](PSO-E-1/README.md)   
[ Customer Details ](PSO-E-2/README.md)   
[ Notes ](PSO-E-3/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The PSO.E procedure provides the ability to process sales in a point of sale
environment. Unlike the multi-step process used with sales orders where the
order is taken, then shipped, then invoiced, and finally paid, point of sales
perfoms all of these functions in one step. The procedure provides the ability
to post to specific customers, create new customers, or post to a general one
time or walk up customer. User defined payment types including credit cards
are used to show payment of the order. Layaway orders are also supported. The
process can be setup with a cash drawer and receipt printer as is typical in
retail environments.

**Frequency of Use**  
As required.

**Prerequisites**  
Setup of the [ MRK.CONTROL ](../MRK-CONTROL/README.md) and [ PSO.CONTROL ](PSO-CONTROL.htm) procedures.
