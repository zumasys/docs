##  Sales Order E-Form Printing (SO.F3)

<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](SO-F3-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The SO.F3 procedure is used to print sales orders on blank paper using a
predefined PDF document as the form background. One of these forms is usually
sent to the customer, while others may be maintained on file as a legal copy
of the agreement between you and the customer. The user determines which sales
orders are to be printed by entering their numbers, a date range or range of
numbers.  
  
The sales order form includes information about all of the shipments which
have processed against it. Therefore, reprints run at a later date may not
look exactly like previous copies.  
  
You may designate that the user be given the option of outputing the sales order form to print, email, fax etc. through the [ MRK.CONTROL ](../../MRK-ENTRY/MRK-CONTROL/README.md) procedure. 

**Frequency of Use**  
Sales order forms may be printed as required and may be also be re-printed at
any time.

**Prerequisites**  
The path to the PDF file to be used as the form background must be specified in the [ FORM.CONTROL ](../../../ACE-OVERVIEW/ACE-ENTRY/FORM-CONTROL/README.md) procedure.
