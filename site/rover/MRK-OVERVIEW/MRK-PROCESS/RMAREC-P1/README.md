**Purpose**  
The RMAREC.P1 procedure is used to post previously entered RMA receipts. If
the RMA indicates that the customer account is to be credited then a credit
memo will be created in the accounts receivable system. Reversals of posted
receipts can also be posted and create debit memos when sepcified. Receipts
may be selected for posting individually or by a cutoff date.

**Frequency of Use**  
It is recommended that the posting procedure be run at the end of each day to
insure that accounts receivable credit memos are created in a timely manner.
Less frequent processing may be done if desired but should be done at least
once a month before the end of the month closing.

**Prerequisites**  
Setup of the appropriate account numbers in the [ AR.CONTROL ](../../../../../../rover/AP-OVERVIEW/AP-ENTRY/CHECKS-E4/AR-CONTROL) procedure.
