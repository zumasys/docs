##  Recalculate SO Balance in the Cust File (SO.P3)

<PageHeader />

**Form Details**  
[ Form Details ](SO-P3-1/README.md)   

**Purpose**  
The SO.P3 procedure recalculates and sets the open order amount in the customer file. This amount is displayed on query procedures such as the customer inquiry ( [ CUST.Q ](../../../AR-OVERVIEW/AR-REPORT/CUST-Q/README.md) ). 

**Frequency of Use**  
The open order amount is maintained automatically as sales orders are entered
and shipments are processed. Therefore, the only time you really need to run
this procedure is when the file has been corrupted or records have been purged
from the sales order file.

**Prerequisites**  
None.
